Found two very helpful Youtubers, The Art of Code and Inigo Quilez, who are very generous to provided useful tutorials for shader writing. I really appreciate that.

Watched some of their videos and **Ray Marching** caught my eyes. It is a different way than the traditional ray casting approach to calculate the distance of the objects. I found it very interesting and did some simple practice.

I'm still in the exploration of this approach new to me. Then I deciced to follow the 5-hour live coding tutorial Happy Jumping. For the first step, a simple sphere with sun light, sky light and shadow, but a lot learned.

Normal calculation: [ref](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/normalsSDF/normalsSDF.htm)
```glsl
vec3 getNormal(in vec3 p) {
    vec2 e = vec2(EPS, 0);
    return normalize(vec3(map(p + e.xyy) - map(p - e.xyy),
                          map(p + e.yxy) - map(p - e.yxy),
                          map(p + e.yyx) - map(p - e.yyx)));
}
```

In here a trick, when a ray doesn't reach any surface, set it to negative `if (t > 20.0) t = -1.;` 

```
float castRay(in vec3 ro, in vec3 rd) {
    float t = 0.;
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_STEPS; i++) {
    	vec3 p = ro + rd * t;
        float d = map(p);
        if (d < EPS) break;
        t += d;
        if (t > MAX_DIST) break;
    }
    if (t > 20.0) t = -1.;
    return t;
}
```

In here when we write the lower sky where it gets a little gray. First, `col` is getting darker when `rd.y` is increasing. `exps` returns the natural exponentiation. `genType mix(genType x, genType y, genType a);` `mix` performs a linear interpolation between x and y using a to weight between them. The return value is computed as `x*(1âˆ’a)+y*a`.

```
vec3 col = vec3(.65, 1., 1.2) - .5 * rd.y;
col = mix(col, vec3(.6, .7, .8), exp(-10. * rd.y));
```

In here the sun shadow. `step` generates a step function by comparing x to edge. For element `i` of the return value, `0.0` is returned if `x[i] < edge[i]`, and `1.0` is returned otherwise.
```
float sun_sha = step(castRay(p + EPS * n, sun_dir), 0.); // in shadow ? 0 : 1
```

Gamma correction, or often simply gamma, is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in video or still image systems. In my understanding, Gamma correction usually gets rid of the 'over-shadowed' color and makes the lighting looks more natural. It is necessary for many simulated scene.
```
col = pow(col, vec3(0.4545)); // gamma correction 
```
