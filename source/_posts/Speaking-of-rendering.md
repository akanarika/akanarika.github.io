Speaking of rendering, I will have to mention this genius - "Octane". As officially introduced, Octane is the worldâ€™s first and fastest GPU-accelerated, unbiased, physically correct renderer. It is said that Octane is insanely fast, especially crazy fast SSS, DOF and Motion Blur. What I was amazed is that works made by Octane are always "unrealisticly" realistic(perhaps also because of the artist's style). It simulates the weather and sky environment throughout 365 days of a year. But, finally, the price is also beautiful, so unfortunately I don't have the chance to own one except for the very limited trial version. So, now, it's in my wishlist. I will purchase one once I get a job... (...)
