In Leetcode problem [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/#/description), a test case 
```
["10","6","9","3","+","-11","","/","","17","+","5","+"]
```
gave a wrong answer. 
After looking into it, it turned out that Python caculates 6 / (-132) as -1, which seems weird to me.
The reason why that happened is that Python's default division of intergers returns the floor(towards negitive infinity). 
A simple way to avoid this is to use 
```python
result = int(float(a) / b).
```
